# HeadlessPilot: Browser Automation Made Easy

## Overview
HeadlessPilot is a desktop application that allows users to automate browser tasks like form filling and taking screenshots after login. It provides an intuitive interface for recording browser interactions and replaying them headlessly. The application is designed for users who need to repeatedly access web content behind login screens or automate form submissions.

## Core Features
1. **Browser Automation Engine**
   - Headless browser control using Puppeteer
   - Support for navigation, form filling, clicking, and taking screenshots
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **Interactive Recording**
   - Record mode that captures user interactions in real-time
   - Automatic element identification and selector generation
   - Visual feedback during recording to indicate captured actions

3. **Smart Element Detection**
   - Analyze web pages to identify interactive elements (forms, buttons, inputs)
   - Generate suggestions for potential automation targets
   - Present detected elements in a user-friendly way

4. **Replay Functionality**
   - Headless execution of recorded sequences
   - Scheduling options for repeated runs
   - Detailed logs of execution process

5. **Visual Results**
   - Screenshot capture at specified points in the automation
   - Visual comparison between runs (optional)
   - Image export functionality

## User Experience
- **Target Users**: Professionals who need to regularly access content behind logins, testers, data collectors
- **Key Workflows**:
  1. Enter URL → App analyzes page → User selects elements to interact with → App records actions → User saves sequence
  2. Select saved sequence → Configure run parameters → Execute headlessly → View results/screenshots
- **UI Requirements**:
  - Clean, modern React-based interface
  - Visual representation of recorded steps
  - Split-pane view showing browser and control panels
  - Intuitive controls for recording, editing, and executing scripts

## Technical Architecture
1. **Frontend**
   - React for UI components
   - Electron for desktop application wrapper
   - State management with Redux or Context API
   - Styled-components or Tailwind CSS for styling

2. **Backend/Core**
   - Node.js runtime
   - Puppeteer for browser automation
   - Express for potential API endpoints
   - File system operations for saving/loading scripts and screenshots

3. **Recorder Module**
   - Custom event listeners for capturing DOM interactions
   - Element selector generation algorithms
   - Action sequencing and storage logic

4. **Player Module**
   - Sequence interpreter
   - Puppeteer script generation
   - Execution engine with hooks for screenshots and logging

5. **Element Analyzer**
   - DOM traversal for form and interactive element detection
   - Heuristics for identifying login forms, buttons, and input fields
   - Suggestion generation for common automation targets

## Development Roadmap
### Phase 1: MVP
- Basic Electron + React application shell
- Simple URL navigation and browser display
- Manual Puppeteer script creation and execution
- Screenshot capture functionality

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- Interactive recording mechanism
- Playback of recorded sequences
- Basic element detection for forms
- Sequence storage and management

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- Improved element detection with AI/ML assistance
- Scheduling and batch execution
- Advanced error handling and recovery
- Report generation and export

### Phase 4: Polish & Extensions
- UI/UX refinements based on user feedback
- Performance optimizations
- Additional browser support (optional)
- Plugin system for extensions (optional)

## Logical Dependency Chain
1. Set up Electron with React (foundation)
2. Implement basic browser display and navigation controls
3. Add Puppeteer integration for headless control
4. Develop recording mechanism to capture user actions
5. Create playback functionality for recorded sequences
6. Implement element detection and analysis
7. Add screenshot and result management
8. Develop sequence storage and management
9. Enhance UI/UX with visual feedback and intuitive controls
10. Add scheduling and advanced execution options

## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Browser Compatibility Issues**
   - Focus initially on Chrome/Chromium via Puppeteer
   - Thorough testing across versions
   - Clear documentation on supported browsers

2. **Website Structure Changes**
   - Implement robust selector strategies
   - Add element verification before actions
   - Error reporting and fallback mechanisms

3. **Performance Concerns**
   - Optimize resource usage during recording/playback
   - Implement batching for heavy operations
   - Profile and optimize critical paths

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Secure storage of sensitive information (if needed)
   - Sandbox browser operations
   - Clear guidelines on ethical usage

## Technical Appendix
### Recording Implementation Approach
The recording functionality will use a combination of:

1. **Puppeteer CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol)** to intercept browser events
2. **MutationObserver** for tracking DOM changes
3. **Custom event listeners** for capturing user interactions

The system will generate selectors using multiple strategies (ID, CSS path, XPath) and choose the most robust option for each element.

### Element Detection Strategy
Element detection will employ:

1. Form detection heuristics (input types, button proximity)
2. Common patterns for login forms (username/password field combinations)
3. Interactive element identification (clickable items, dropdowns, etc.)

The system will rank elements by likelihood of being automation targets and present them to the user in an intuitive visual manner.
