# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement state management with Redux
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up Redux for application state management to handle complex state interactions
# Details:
1. Install Redux and related packages:
   ```
   npm install redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-logger
   ```
2. Define action types:
   ```javascript
   // actionTypes.js
   export const SEQUENCE_ACTIONS = {
     CREATE_SEQUENCE: 'CREATE_SEQUENCE',
     UPDATE_SEQUENCE: 'UPDATE_SEQUENCE',
     DELETE_SEQUENCE: 'DELETE_SEQUENCE',
     SET_CURRENT_SEQUENCE: 'SET_CURRENT_SEQUENCE'
   };
   
   export const RECORDING_ACTIONS = {
     START_RECORDING: 'START_RECORDING',
     STOP_RECORDING: 'STOP_RECORDING',
     ADD_RECORDED_ACTION: 'ADD_RECORDED_ACTION'
   };
   
   export const PLAYBACK_ACTIONS = {
     START_PLAYBACK: 'START_PLAYBACK',
     STOP_PLAYBACK: 'STOP_PLAYBACK',
     PLAYBACK_PROGRESS: 'PLAYBACK_PROGRESS',
     PLAYBACK_COMPLETE: 'PLAYBACK_COMPLETE',
     PLAYBACK_ERROR: 'PLAYBACK_ERROR'
   };
   ```
3. Create action creators:
   ```javascript
   // sequenceActions.js
   import { SEQUENCE_ACTIONS } from './actionTypes';
   
   export const createSequence = (sequence) => ({
     type: SEQUENCE_ACTIONS.CREATE_SEQUENCE,
     payload: sequence
   });
   
   export const updateSequence = (id, updates) => ({
     type: SEQUENCE_ACTIONS.UPDATE_SEQUENCE,
     payload: { id, updates }
   });
   ```
4. Implement reducers:
   ```javascript
   // sequenceReducer.js
   import { SEQUENCE_ACTIONS } from '../actions/actionTypes';
   
   const initialState = {
     sequences: [],
     currentSequence: null
   };
   
   export default function sequenceReducer(state = initialState, action) {
     switch (action.type) {
       case SEQUENCE_ACTIONS.CREATE_SEQUENCE:
         return {
           ...state,
           sequences: [...state.sequences, action.payload]
         };
       case SEQUENCE_ACTIONS.UPDATE_SEQUENCE:
         return {
           ...state,
           sequences: state.sequences.map(seq =>
             seq.id === action.payload.id
               ? { ...seq, ...action.payload.updates }
               : seq
           )
         };
       // Handle other actions
       default:
         return state;
     }
   }
   ```
5. Configure the Redux store:
   ```javascript
   // store.js
   import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
   import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
   import logger from 'redux-logger';
   import sequenceReducer from './reducers/sequenceReducer';
   import recordingReducer from './reducers/recordingReducer';
   import playbackReducer from './reducers/playbackReducer';
   
   const rootReducer = combineReducers({
     sequences: sequenceReducer,
     recording: recordingReducer,
     playback: playbackReducer
   });
   
   const store = createStore(
     rootReducer,
     applyMiddleware(thunk, logger)
   );
   
   export default store;
   ```
6. Connect components to Redux store
7. Implement async actions using Redux Thunk

# Test Strategy:
1. Test action creators return correct action objects
2. Verify reducers correctly update state for each action
3. Test connected components receive correct props
4. Validate async actions with mock API calls
5. Test store configuration and middleware
6. Verify state persistence where applicable
