# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create playback functionality for recorded sequences
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the ability to replay recorded browser automation sequences headlessly
# Details:
1. Create a SequencePlayer class:
   ```javascript
   class SequencePlayer {
     constructor() {
       this.automation = null;
       this.currentSequence = null;
       this.isPlaying = false;
       this.results = [];
     }
     
     async initialize() {
       this.automation = await new BrowserAutomation().initialize();
     }
     
     async play(sequence) {
       this.isPlaying = true;
       this.currentSequence = sequence;
       this.results = [];
       
       try {
         await this.automation.navigate(sequence.startUrl);
         
         for (const action of sequence.actions) {
           await this.executeAction(action);
         }
         
         return this.results;
       } catch (error) {
         this.results.push({
           type: 'error',
           message: error.message,
           timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
         });
         throw error;
       } finally {
         this.isPlaying = false;
       }
     }
     
     async executeAction(action) {
       switch (action.type) {
         case 'click':
           await this.automation.click(action.selector);
           break;
         case 'type':
           await this.automation.type(action.selector, action.value);
           break;
         // Handle other action types
       }
       
       this.results.push({
         type: 'success',
         action: action,
         timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
       });
     }
   }
   ```
2. Implement execution hooks for screenshots and logging
3. Add progress reporting during playback
4. Implement error handling and recovery strategies
5. Create UI components for playback control and status display
6. Add options for headless/headed playback modes

# Test Strategy:
1. Test playback of simple recorded sequences
2. Verify handling of different action types
3. Test error handling with intentionally broken sequences
4. Validate screenshot capture during playback
5. Test with complex sequences involving multiple pages
6. Measure playback performance and reliability
